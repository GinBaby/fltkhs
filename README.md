FLTKC - A C Binding to the FLTK GUI Library
=============================================

FLTKC aims to be a complete C binding to the [FLTK GUI library] [1]. It's only dependencies are gcc, g++ and FLTK 1.3.x.

The ``src'' directory contains the ported widgets and functions.

The ``examples'' contains ports of some of the examples provided with the FLTK distribution.

This README will be more complete once the bindings are ready for release.
